To effectively use SQL clauses like `SUM`, `GROUP BY`, `WHERE`, and `HAVING`, it’s essential to understand their roles, restrictions, and the logical order of execution in an SQL query. Let’s break it down systematically.

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Single-Row Functions (No `GROUP BY`)**:
   - Aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc., can operate on all rows as a single group when no `GROUP BY` is used.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
     FROM EMPLOYEES;
     ```
     This calculates the total salary across the entire table.

2. **Multi-Row Functions (With `GROUP BY`)**:
   - `GROUP BY` is used to split rows into groups based on one or more columns. Aggregate functions then operate **within each group**.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
     FROM EMPLOYEES
     GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
     ```
     Here, `SUM(SALARY)` calculates the total salary for each department.

### **When to Use `GROUP BY`**
- Use `GROUP BY` when you need **group-wise calculations** (e.g., total sales per region, average salary per department).
- Without `GROUP BY`, aggregate functions treat the entire dataset as a single group.
- Example:
  - **Without `GROUP BY`**:
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary FROM EMPLOYEES;
    ```
    Calculates the total salary for all employees.
  - **With `GROUP BY`**:
    ```sql
    SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
    FROM EMPLOYEES
    GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
    ```
    Splits employees by department and calculates total salary for each department.

### **Where You Can Use `WHERE`**
- `WHERE` filters rows **before grouping or aggregation**.
- You cannot use aggregate functions (like `SUM` or `COUNT`) in the `WHERE` clause because aggregation happens **after filtering**.
- Example:
  - Valid:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE SALARY > 5000;
    ```
    Filters rows where `SALARY` is greater than 5000.
  - Invalid:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE SUM(SALARY) > 5000;
    ```
    This is invalid because `SUM(SALARY)` is computed after the `WHERE` clause is executed.

---

### **When to Use `HAVING`**
- `HAVING` filters **after grouping/aggregation**.
- Use `HAVING` to filter groups based on aggregate functions.
- Example:
  ```sql
  SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
  FROM EMPLOYEES
  GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
  HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 10000;
  ```
  This filters groups (departments) where the total salary exceeds 10,000.

---

### **Correct Order of SQL Clauses**
1. **FROM**: Identify the table(s) to query.
2. **WHERE**: Filter rows before grouping/aggregation.
3. **GROUP BY**: Divide the filtered rows into groups.
4. **HAVING**: Filter groups after aggregation.
5. **SELECT**: Choose the columns/aggregates to display.
6. **ORDER BY**: Sort the result set.

---

### **Single-Row vs. Multi-Row**
- **Single-Row Queries**:
  - Aggregate functions without `GROUP BY`.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(SALARY) FROM EMPLOYEES;
    ```
    Single value for the entire table.

- **Multi-Row Queries**:
  - Aggregate functions with `GROUP BY`.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY)
    FROM EMPLOYEES
    GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
    ```
    One value per group.

### **Examples: Combining Clauses**

#### Example 1: Total Salary Across All Departments
```sql
SELECT SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES;
```

#### Example 2: Total Salary Per Department
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
```

#### Example 3: Departments With Total Salary > 20,000
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 20000;
```

#### Example 4: Employees Earning Above 5,000 in Departments With Total Salary > 20,000
```sql
SELECT Name, DEPARTMENT, SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY > 5000 AND DEPARTMENT IN (
    SELECT DEPARTMENT
    FROM EMPLOYEES
    GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
    HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 20000
);
```

---

### Summary
- **`WHERE`**: Filters individual rows before grouping/aggregation.
- **`GROUP BY`**: Groups rows based on column values.
- **`HAVING`**: Filters groups after aggregation.
- **Single-row operations**: No `GROUP BY`, aggregates operate on all rows.
- **Multi-row operations**: Use `GROUP BY` for grouped aggregates.
