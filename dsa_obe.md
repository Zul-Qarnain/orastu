**a) Data Structure:**

A structured array or a list of structures would be an appropriate data structure. Each structure would represent a student's record and contain the following fields:

```c
struct Student {
  int ID;
  string Name;
  int Quiz1;
  int Quiz2;
  int BestQ;
  int Term;
  int Total;
};

Student students[40]; // Array to store records of 40 students
```



**b) Pseudocode:**

I'll provide pseudocode for i) and iii). You only need two.

**i) Difference between highest and lowest BestQ:**

```
function differenceInBestQ(students : array of Student): integer

  highestBestQ = 0
  lowestBestQ = 100 // Assuming maximum possible marks are 100

  for each student in students:
    if student.BestQ > highestBestQ:
      highestBestQ = student.BestQ
    if student.BestQ < lowestBestQ:
      lowestBestQ = student.BestQ

  return highestBestQ - lowestBestQ
end function
```


**iii) Calculate BestQ and Total:**

```
function calculateBestQandTotal(studentID : integer, quiz1 : integer, quiz2 : integer, term : integer): array
    
  bestQ = maximum(quiz1, quiz2)
  total = bestQ + term

  return [bestQ, total] // return an array or structure containing the two calculated values

end function

```

**Explanation of Pseudocode for iii):**

1. **Input:**  The function takes the student's ID, Quiz1 marks, Quiz2 marks, and Term marks as input.  Although the student ID isn't used in the calculation itself in this particular example, it would be necessary if you were updating an existing record within the `students` array based on ID.

2. **Calculate BestQ:** `bestQ` is determined by taking the maximum value between Quiz1 and Quiz2.

3. **Calculate Total:** The `total` is calculated by adding `bestQ` and the `term` marks.

4. **Return Values:** The function returns both the calculated `bestQ` and `total` (either as an array with two elements, or as a structure with `bestQ` and `total` fields). You could then use these returned values to update the relevant student record in the larger `students` array, display them, or use them in other calculations.


If you were updating the student records, you would add logic to find the student in the array using their ID and then update their `BestQ` and `Total` fields with the calculated values.
