Hereâ€™s an explanation of **valid and invalid usage** of `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `WHERE`, illustrated with examples based on a simple `EMPLOYEES` table.

### **Assumed `EMPLOYEES` Table**
| Name      | Department | Salary |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Alice     | HR         | 5000   |
| Bob       | IT         | 6000   |
| Charlie   | HR         | 7000   |
| Diana     | IT         | 8000   |
| Edward    | Finance    | 9000   |

### **Valid and Invalid Examples**
#### **1. Using `WHERE` with `GROUP BY`**

**Valid Example: Filtering rows before grouping**
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SALARY > 5000
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `WHERE SALARY > 5000` filters rows first (removes Alice).
  - Then, rows are grouped by `DEPARTMENT`, and `SUM(SALARY)` is calculated for each group.

**Invalid Example: Using aggregate functions in `WHERE`**
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES
WHERE SUM(SALARY) > 10000
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
```
- **Error**: `SUM(SALARY)` is calculated after grouping, so it cannot be used in `WHERE`.
- **Fix**: Use `HAVING` instead.

---

#### **2. Using `HAVING` without `GROUP BY`**

**Valid Example: Aggregate function applied to the entire table**
```sql
SELECT SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES
HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 20000;
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The entire table is treated as a single group since no `GROUP BY` is used.
  - `HAVING` checks the condition on the aggregate result.

**Invalid Example: `HAVING` without an aggregate function**
```sql
SELECT SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES
HAVING SALARY > 5000;
```
- **Error**: `HAVING` is used to filter aggregated results, but `SALARY > 5000` applies to individual rows, which should be handled by `WHERE`.
- **Fix**: Use `WHERE` for row-level filtering.

---

#### **3. Using `GROUP BY` without Aggregates**

**Valid Example: Group rows by a column and return non-aggregated values**
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
```
- **Explanation**:
  - Groups rows by `DEPARTMENT` and lists unique department names.

**Invalid Example: Selecting non-grouped columns**
```sql
SELECT Name, DEPARTMENT
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;
```
- **Error**: `Name` is not included in `GROUP BY` or an aggregate function, leading to ambiguity.
- **Fix**: Add `Name` to `GROUP BY` or use an aggregate function.

---

#### **4. Using `HAVING` with `GROUP BY`**

**Valid Example: Filtering groups after aggregation**
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
HAVING SUM(SALARY) > 15000;
```
- **Explanation**:
  - Groups rows by `DEPARTMENT`.
  - Calculates `SUM(SALARY)` for each department.
  - Filters departments with total salary greater than 15,000.

**Invalid Example: Using column without aggregation in `HAVING`**
```sql
SELECT DEPARTMENT, SUM(SALARY) AS total_salary
FROM EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
HAVING SALARY > 5000;
```
- **Error**: `SALARY` is not aggregated or used in `GROUP BY`, making it invalid in `HAVING`.
- **Fix**: Aggregate `SALARY` in the `HAVING` clause.

### **Key Points on Valid and Invalid Usage**

#### **`WHERE`**
- Filters rows **before grouping/aggregation**.
- **Cannot** use aggregate functions in `WHERE`.

#### **`GROUP BY`**
- Groups rows into groups based on specified columns.
- All selected columns must either:
  - Be part of the `GROUP BY` clause, or
  - Be used with an aggregate function.

#### **`HAVING`**
- Filters groups **after aggregation**.
- **Can** use aggregate functions.
- Cannot use row-level conditions that are not aggregated.

### **Logical Order of Execution**
The SQL query is processed in this order:
1. **`FROM`**: Specify the source table(s).
2. **`WHERE`**: Filter rows based on conditions.
3. **`GROUP BY`**: Group the filtered rows.
4. **Aggregate Functions**: Apply aggregate functions to groups.
5. **`HAVING`**: Filter groups based on aggregated results.
6. **`SELECT`**: Choose columns to display in the result.
7. **`ORDER BY`**: Sort the result set.

| Clause       | When to Use                                                                                          | Invalid Cases                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **WHERE**    | Row-level filtering before grouping.                                                                | Using aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, etc.) in `WHERE`.                                                                                   |
| **GROUP BY** | Group rows for aggregate calculations.                                                              | Selecting non-aggregated, non-grouped columns.                                                                                               |
| **HAVING**   | Group-level filtering after aggregation.                                                            | Using non-aggregated columns in `HAVING`. Using it without an aggregate function (unless the table is treated as one group).                 |
